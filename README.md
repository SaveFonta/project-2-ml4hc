## ðŸ”§ Dataset Setup & Configuration

To get started, install the required Python packages:

`pip install kagglehub python-dotenv loguru tqdm`

Then, create a `.env` file in the project root (at the same level as `proj2/`) and configure your Kaggle credentials along with a custom cache directory for downloads. You can use the provided `.env.example` as a starting point.

The dataset download script (`proj2/dataset.py`) is designed to:

- Automatically load credentials from the `.env` file
- Use kagglehub to download datasets
- Store downloaded files in the directory defined by `KAGGLEHUB_CACHE`
- Check if the datasets already exist locally before downloading

By default, it manages the following datasets:

- `data/external/datasets/fedesoriano` â€“ Heart Failure Prediction
- `data/external/datasets/paultimothymooney` â€“ Chest X-Ray Pneumonia

If these folders are not found, the script will download and extract the datasets into them. This ensures that all team members have a consistent and reproducible environment.
To run the script, ensure your working directory is the project root, then execute:

`python -m proj2.dataset`

Or, use the provided VSCode launch configuration for convenience.

### ðŸ“‚ Additional Required Folder: `data/raw`

To support saving preprocessed NumPy datasets (used for faster loading and reproducibility), you must also create the following folder manually:

```
data/raw/
```

This folder is used to store compressed `.npz` versions of the processed image data. These files are automatically created the first time you run the dataset loader (see `get_data_set_loader` in `proj2/dataloader.py`) if they do not already exist. The folder is **not versioned in Git** (it's listed in `.gitignore`) to avoid bloating the repository with large files.

**Make sure to create this folder** before running training or visualization scripts that depend on preprocessed data.

You can create it manually or run the following command from the project root:

```bash
mkdir -p data/raw
```
